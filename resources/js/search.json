Taking the hash of a picture with hashes inside of it, will likely lead to confusion as we lose our understanding of what those hashes are.","But these hashing algorithms offer this functionality at the expense of memory.

Well the recognition streams should stream their perceptions of the positions in the array of the picture they are referencing. Bob could say \"I believe that the object you beleive I am referring to is in position 2\"","Inside of each of these pictures we can have many identical but necessarily unique objects.","Javascript Sets: Set objects are collections of values. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was inserted into the set by the add() method successfully (that is, there wasn't an identical element already in the set when add() was called).","Memoization procedures for finding the optimal compression between pure and impure pictures, is crucial, and indeed common ground about the picture of pure pictures can greatly reduce confusion for all.","One hash can corrspond to:","reorganizing our pointers in a common order","several possible meanings of the hashes in these picture","several possible pictures","several possible recognition streams about these possible pictures","So grounding perceptions of what is being pointed at, allows for:","So we should start with taking the hash of pictures that contain no hashes, let's call these pure pictures.","Sounds great! But there's a catch: hash-collisions. Two pictures might have the same hash!","The specification requires sets to be implemented \"that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection\". Therefore, it could be represented internally as a hash table (with O(1) lookup), a search tree (with O(log(N)) lookup), or any other data structure, as long as the complexity is better than O(N).","These pure pictures serve as the skeletal structure of the more unknown impure pictures, which itself serves as a backdrop that allows us to reason about and ground perceptions of possible/impossible/necessary/contingent pictures and the relations between them and their hashes.","this aids us in memoization of the structure","This also means that of all the possible pictures stored at a hash and all the possible meanings for the pictures elements stored there as well.
